[Security Audit Report for MoleCity Contracts.pdf](https://github.com/mole-city/molecity_security/files/7233784/Security.Audit.Report.for.MoleCity.Contracts.pdf)

"In this audit, we have analyzed the business logic, the design, and the implementation of the MoleCity Contracts. Overall, the current code base is well-structured and implemented. Most of the issues that we pointed out have been fixed, and the project party ensures that assets with callback mechanism (like ERC777) will not be supported. Meanwhile, as previously disclaimed, this report does not give any warranties on discovering all security issues of the smart contracts. We appreciate any constructive feedback or suggestions."      ----By BlockSec Security Team
